# AGENTS

## Core rule
Update `README.md` with useful information as you build the project (don’t include trivial stuff). Always ask me for architectural decisions.

## Agent Notes
- Read “Visual Style” in README.md to make sure you understand the project.
- Current visual direction: warm gradients, soft glow, Space Grotesk + Fraunces.
- This app is SvelteKit-based and currently scoped to a single, centered note.
- Dependencies should stay aligned with Svelte 5 + SvelteKit 2.
- Think about the best possible forward-looking architecture. Don’t be afraid to make big changes.
- Refactor code as you see fit. When adding code, always look for oppotunities to remove unused code.
- Don’t use workarounds. Take time to get to the right solution.
- When you find something isn’t working, don’t just try a workaround. Think and find out what’s actually wrong under the hood.
- By default, don’t worry about backwards compatibility or migration. Always shoot for the cleanest and leanest architecture and code. If you think there are critical compatibility issues, stop and ask me what to do.
- For all my asks, if you think it doesn’t make sense, or there’s a better way to do things, please stop and tell me.
